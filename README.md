## About

#### Mission Statement
To make people's lives easier by providing an easy and logical way to keep track
of the content of your refrigerator. We believe that having to open your fridge 
every time you need to go shopping and trying to figure out what you are running
out of should be a thing of the past. Why not keep the contents of your fridge,
say, on your smartphone? Arrived at the grocery store and forgot whether you need
to buy onions? It would be great if you could simpyl pull out your phone and check!

#### Wait, how?
People communicate most easily through language, and speech recognition software
is always getting better and better. With Fridge-Friend, all you need to do is 
tell your fridge what you are putting in and what you are taking out, and our
software does the rest!

#### I don't get it.
Example: You come home from the store and put some new items in the fridge.
    "Adding 4 onions, 5 sausages, and 4 pounds of meat."
  Fridge-Friend will store in its database 4 onions, 5 sausages, and 4 pounds of
  meat. 
  Now let's say you need to use one of those onions and 2 sausages.
    "Removing 1 onion and 2 sausages."
  Fridge-Friend will update the database to represent those changes.
  
#### Okay, that's pretty cool, is that all I can look forward to?
No!! With this database of information, Fridge-Friend will eventually cross-reference
the food in your fridge with a database of common food items and expiration dates,
and will be able to let you know when your food is going bad so you can either
eat it before then or throw it out on time! 

I don't know about you, but I hate making shopping lists. Luckily, Fridge-Friend
will soon be able to export the items that you are running low on to a document
of your choice, say OneNote, at the press of a button!
